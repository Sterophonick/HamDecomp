HAMDECOMP

A very WIP decompilation project, aiming to reverse engineer the HAM Game Boy Advance development library.

I probably won't ever finish this, but it's a nice exercise to learn how reverse engineering works.

Current progress:
 - ham.c - COMPLETE
 - fx.c - COMPLETE
 - Everything Else - lol no

pls halp
